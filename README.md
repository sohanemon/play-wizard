| `play-wizard speed +<value>` or `-<value>` | Adjust playback speed relative to the current speed (e.g., `+0.1` to increase by 0.1x). | `play-wizard speed +0.1`            |

### **Additional Notes**
- **Toggle Command**:  
  If any players are playing, the `toggle` command will pause them. If none are playing, it resumes playback on players paused by Play-Wizard.  

- **Playback Speed**:  
  - Use `play-wizard speed <value>` for absolute speed changes (e.g., `1.5` for 1.5x speed).  
  - Use `play-wizard speed +<value>` or `-<value>` for relative speed changes (e.g., `+0.1` to increase speed by 0.1x).  
  - The speed is rounded to two decimal places to ensure consistency.
