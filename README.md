## **Dependencies**

To use Play-Wizard, you need:  
- Python 3  
- `dbus-python` library  

## **Setup**

Setup is simple:  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sohanemon/play-wizard
   cd play-wizard
   ```  
2. Install the program:  
   ```bash
   makepkg -si
   ```  

## **Usage**

Play-Wizard lets you control media players with straightforward commands:  
- **Pause playback** for all running media players:  
  ```bash
  play-wizard pause
  ```  
- **Resume playback** of media players paused by Play-Wizard:  
  ```bash
  play-wizard play
  ```  
- **Stop playback** on all media players:  
  ```bash
  play-wizard stop
  ```  
- **Skip to the next track** on all playing media players:  
  ```bash
  play-wizard next
  ```  
- **Play the previous track** on all playing media players:  
  ```bash
  play-wizard previous
  ```  
- **Toggle playback state** of all media players:  
  ```bash
  play-wizard toggle
  ```  
  > **Note:** If any players are playing, the toggle command will pause them. If none are playing, it resumes playback on players paused by Play-Wizard.  

- **Seek** to a position in the current track:  
  ```bash
  play-wizard seek <seconds>
  ```  

- **Set playback speed** for all players:  
  ```bash
  play-wizard speed <multiplier>
  ```  
  Example: `play-wizard speed 1.5` for 1.5x playback speed.
